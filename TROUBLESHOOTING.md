# Troubleshooting: "Page not found" Error

## ✅ What I Fixed

1. **Removed problematic redirect** - The `netlify.toml` had a redirect that was causing issues
2. **Added `_redirects` file** - Ensures proper routing for static files
3. **Simplified configuration** - Kept only the essential settings

## What to Do Now

### 1. Wait for Netlify to Redeploy

Changes have been pushed to your repository. Netlify should automatically detect the changes and redeploy within 1-2 minutes. You can check the status:
- Go to your Netlify dashboard
- Click on your site
- Go to **Deploys** tab to see the deployment progress

### 2. Check the Correct URL

Once deployed, visit these URLs:
- **Login page**: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/`
- **Portal page**: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/portal.html`

### 3. If Still Getting "Page Not Found"

#### Check Build Settings in Netlify

1. Go to **Site settings** → **Build & deploy**
2. Verify these settings:
   - **Base directory**: (leave blank or `.`)
   - **Build command**: (leave blank)
   - **Publish directory**: `.` or leave blank
3. Click **Save**

#### Force a New Deploy

1. Go to **Deploys** tab
2. Click **Trigger deploy** → **Deploy site**
3. Wait for the build to complete

### 4. Verify Netlify Identity is Enabled

1. Go to **Identity** → **Settings**
2. Make sure **Enable Identity** is turned ON
3. Click **Enable & configure** if you see a button

### 5. Check Browser Console

1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the **Console** tab
3. Look for any red error messages
4. Share any errors you see for further debugging

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Function not found"

**Solution**: 
- Go to **Functions** in Netlify dashboard
- You should see `get-client` listed
- If not, check that `netlify/functions/get-client.js` exists in your repository

### Issue: Authentication doesn't work

**Solution**:
1. Ensure Netlify Identity is enabled
2. Go to **Identity** → **Users** and invite yourself:
   - Email: `michaelnakhla00@gmail.com` (or the email from `clients.json`)
3. Check your email for the invite

### Issue: Data not loading

**Solution**:
1. After logging in, check browser console for errors
2. Verify function logs in Netlify dashboard under **Functions**
3. Check that `data/clients.json` exists and is valid JSON

## Testing Locally

If you want to test locally before deploying:

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Run local development server
netlify dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8888` in your browser.

## Still Having Issues?

If the problem persists after waiting for the redeploy:

1. **Check the Deploy logs**:
   - Go to Netlify dashboard → **Deploys**
   - Click on the latest deploy
   - Scroll down to see build logs
   - Look for any errors or warnings

2. **Try clearing cache**:
   - Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Try an incognito/private window

3. **Verify file structure**:
   - Make sure these files exist in your repository root:
     - `index.html`
     - `portal.html`
     - `_redirects`
     - `netlify.toml`
     - `data/clients.json`
     - `netlify/functions/get-client.js`

## Quick Status Check

Visit these pages to verify each part:
- ✅ `/index.html` - Should show login page
- ✅ `/portal.html` - Should require login
- ✅ `/.netlify/functions/get-client` - Should return function error (needs auth)
